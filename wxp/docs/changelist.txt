To add:
  - Windowing in FFT
  - Beat detection
  - Graphics
  - VGA controller

To remove:
  - Data paths from SD Card to SRAM, wav parser etc. Basically, the
    only audio comes from the DAC.

To modify:
  - Remove analog bypass in codec. Audio loopback path to be
    ADC -> Buffer -> DAC  ??? Perhaps synced with FFT/beat processing.
