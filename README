    syn·es·the·sia - "... a condition in which a sensory stimulus presented in one modality
                      evokes a sensation in a different modality"
                                                    - http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Synesthesia


Synesthesia is an FPGA project that aims to study the deeper inter-
relationships that exist in our perceptions of light & sound. It
tries to answer the questions "What makes a good visualization".

Is there really a difference between light & sound? Are they not
different manifestations of a singular experience? The deeper one
tries to understand the beautiful entanglements of light & sound,
the more one undersands on how one percieves them; of how the
experience is created in one's mind.

Target System

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Synesthesia is designed & architected for the DE1 FPGA board manufactured
by Terasic. For more details, visit the link
                      http://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?No=83

Given the hardware rigidity, the internal modules are designed to be as
generic as possible. There are however many tight HW-SW couplings that
have infulenced the architecture, which makes migrating to embedded
processors other than NIOS II very difficult.

  - There are Altera Megafunction generated blocks (found in dgn/rtl/altera folder)
    that have been generated using Quartus tool from Altera.  They
